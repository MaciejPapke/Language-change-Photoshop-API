#  Language-change-Photoshop-API

This is a small personal project that changes visible layers in my CV Photoshop file and prints a pdf in each language. 
It allowed me to quickly make changes to CV and ommit changing all the layers manually and printing.
The layers are set up with names starting with ENG and NOK for English and Norwegian respectively.
Code iterates over layers that are hidden within groups in the file and switches their visibility accordingly.
